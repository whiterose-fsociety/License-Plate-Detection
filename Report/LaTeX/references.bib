abstract = {ALPR (Automatic License plate recognition) is a method which uses Information and Communication technologies and is a step in Sustainable Transportation. The method proposed in this paper is being used to trap traffic violations in an enclosed space like an office, college, etc. Our approach works as follows. The camera is being used to take the image in the form of license plate and then this image is refined using various methods like erosion, thinning, Convolution and then finally using the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technique. The image is now extracted on the notepad in the form of text. These characters are then compared with a pre stored database containing the details about the employee along with mobile number and vehicle number. When a match of the offender’s license plate and that of an employee’s license plate is found, then he/she is sent a message (a warning) on his registered mobile number. The proposed approach can be used to trap offenders disobeying the traffic rules, e.g. if the speed of the vehicle is more than prescribed in the campus or if the number of riders on a two wheeler is more than 2, etc, then an automated system helps to achieve the same. This approach owing its high accuracy and its use in sustainability can be extended to cities as well.}
